## Typical setup for interns

Standard work flow at Mueller is using GitHub to manage/store all our code. In order for this to work, the following are required: A GitHub account needs to be setup, a Git client, a reposotory (or repo), and a working directory.

1. GitHub - From github.com, setup an account. Use your personal email. We'll link our "Development Team" to your account. Email Tim or Diego the email you used. Access to certain repos will be given to you.

2. Git client - Linux systems come or download (sudo apt-get install git) git as a client. No further work needs to be done. Windows users can download different clients. I prefer SourceTree. This requires you to setup an account with BitBucket (similar service to GitHub). You'll only need it during setup. Once it's setup, you'll login to GitHub from SourceTree.

3. Tim or Diego will setup a repo for you to work in.

4. Once a repo has been setup, you'll clone the repo using the git client. This will be your working directory.
